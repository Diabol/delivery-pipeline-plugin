Run certain post-build actions once the join is achieved.  The authors of the post-build actions
did not have the join plugin in mind when writing their actions, so only a select few are shown here.

<p>The join plugin can work with the paramaterized-trigger plugin, version 2.0 or later.   Earlier versions
will experience a NPE when started by the join plugin.

<p>If there is a post-build action you would like to see supported, <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa">please file an issue</a>.   Use the 'join' component.
