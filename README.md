The purpose of the Delivery Pipeline plugin is to provide visualisation of delivery/build pipelines in Jenkins. The plugin is perfect for Continuous Delivery pipeline visualisation on information radiators.

In Continuous Delivery, fast feedback and visualisation of the delivery process is one of the most important aspects. When using Jenkins as a build server it is now possible to visualise one or more delivery pipelines in the same view (even in full screen!) using the Delivery Pipeline plugin. You can install the Delivery Pipeline plugin using the Jenkins plugin management.

We use the official Jenkins [issue tracker](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&reset=true&jqlQuery=project+%3D+JENKINS+AND+status+in+%28Open%2C+%22In+Progress%22%2C+Reopened%29+AND+component+%3D+%27delivery-pipeline-plugin%27) for bugs, improvements and new features. Please report any issues on component [delivery-pipeline-plugin](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS/component/18134).

This plugin has been contributed to the community by [Diabol AB](http://www.diabol.se).

Requirements
---
Delivery Pipeline plugin 1.0.0 and later requires Java 7 and Jenkins core 1.642.3 or later.

Delivery Pipeline plugin 0.10.3 requires Java 6 and Jenkins core 1.565 or later.

Build
---
    mvn clean install

Requires Java 7, Apache Maven 3.3.x or later.

Run locally
---
    mvn hpi:run

Run function tests
---
    mvn integration-test

Create Jenkins plugin artifact
---
    mvn hpi:hpi

This can be used to manually upload a new plugin through the Jenkins plugin management console (under the Advanced tab).

Build and run the Delivery Pipeline plugin in a Docker container
----
    mvn clean install
    docker build -t dpp .
    docker run -p 8080:8080 dpp

Configuring manually triggered jobs
----
**Note:** This requires the Build Pipeline plugin to be installed.

To be able to configure a certain job in the pipeline as a manual step, you have to configure the upstream job that triggers the job which is to be performed manually to be marked as a manual step.

In the Jenkins UI this shows up as a Post-Build Action: Build other projects (manual step), where you configure the name of the job to be manually triggered in the "Downstream Project Names".

If you're creating your jobs with JobDSL, use the following syntax in the publishers section (parameters is optional):

    publishers {
        buildPipelineTrigger('name-of-the-manually-triggered-job') {
            parameters {
                propertiesFile('env.${BUILD_NUMBER}.properties')
            }
        }
    }

In your pipeline configuration, make sure to enable manual triggers. The manual triggers (a play button) will not be shown in the UI for aggregate pipelines, only for pipeline instances. If you want to access manual triggers from the UI, make sure to show at least one pipeline instance.

Here is an example of a corresponding JobDSL pipeline view configuration:

    deliveryPipelineView("my-pipeline") {
        name("my-pipeline")
        description("Delivery pipeline with a manual trigger")
        pipelineInstances(1)
        showAggregatedPipeline(false)
        columns(1)
        updateInterval(2)
        enableManualTriggers(true)
        showAvatars(false)
        showChangeLog(true)
        pipelines {
            component("My pipeline", "the-name-of-the-first-job-in-the-pipeline")
        }
    }

Using a custom CSS
----
Here is an example of how to specify a custom CSS for the Delivery Pipeline Plugin using a JobDSL pipeline view configuration:

    deliveryPipelineView("my-pipeline") {
        name("my-pipeline")
        description("Delivery pipeline with custom full screen CSS")
        pipelineInstances(1)
        showAggregatedPipeline(false)
        columns(1)
        updateInterval(2)
        enableManualTriggers(true)
        showAvatars(false)
        showChangeLog(true)
        configure { node ->
            node << {
                fullScreenCss('https://my-jenkins-instance/userContent/my-pipeline-fullscreen.css')
            }
        }
        pipelines {
            component("My pipeline", "the-name-of-the-first-job-in-the-pipeline")
        }
    }

How to contribute
---
Read GitHub's general contribution guidelines: https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing

It basically comes down to the following guidelines:
 1. If applicable, create a [Jira issue](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/issues/?jql=project+%3D+JENKINS+AND+component+%3D+delivery-pipeline-plugin)
    + Make sure a similar issue doesn't already exist
 2. Fork the repo
 3. Contribute and have fun!
 4. Add as much unit testing as possible to any new code changes
    + This will make the code much more easy to maintain and to understand its intent
 5. Make sure your code is well formatted and aligns with the projects code style conventions
 6. Make sure to prefix the commit message with the associated Jira issue number together with a descriptive commit message
 7. If you have multiple commits, please make sure to squash them before creating a pull request
    + It's hard to follow contributions when they are scattered across several commits
 8. Create a pull request to get feedback from the maintainers
    + Add a link to the pull request to the associated Jira issue
