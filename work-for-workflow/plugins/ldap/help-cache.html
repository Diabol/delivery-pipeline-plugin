    Some LDAP servers may be slow, or rate limit client requests. In such cases enabling caching may improve performance
    of Jenkins with the risk of delayed propagation of user changes from LDAP and increased memory usage on the master.

    <b>Note:</b> The default configuration is to leave the cache turned off.
